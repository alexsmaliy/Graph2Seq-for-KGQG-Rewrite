#### What is this?

This is a partial rewrite of [hugochan/Graph2Seq-for-KGQG](https://github.com/hugochan/Graph2Seq-for-KGQG)
using PyTorch that's modern for 2024.

#### Config
This is very work-in-progress, but the project is managed with
Conda and comes with a Conda `environment.yml` file. Make a
reproducible Conda environment with:
```shell
conda env create -n <name> -f environment.yml
```
